2023-10-18,1697649988,Re-Imagining The NHL Playoffs - Swiss Stage Week,"Hi there! I had a crazy idea based on what League of Legends is doing hah.  What if the NHL did a Swiss Tournament for the lower seeds in each conference to get the last playoff spots?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically it works like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Swiss Format](https://preview.redd.it/03p86w8ywzub1.png?width=1409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cbde3f7357b892c77d77e7fa8ff27b76e38f0f5)

Top 4 seeds of the regular season are in: The Conference Winner, the 2nd Division Winner, and the top two wildcard teams.  They get 'Swiss Tournament Week' off to prepare and rest up.

Teams 5-12 are in a Swiss Tournament, where during the course of the week, they play up to three games and have to win twice to advance to the playoffs, or lose twice to be eliminated.

So Seed 5 would face Seed 12, Seed 6 would face Seed 11, etc. on Tournament Day 1.  The winners would be placed in the 1-0 bracket and the losers would be placed in the 0-1 bracket.  They would continue to be matched based on their regular season seeding, so the highest seed would face the lowest seed in each of those brackets.  

Tournament Day 2 has those 1-0 and 0-1 games.  The 2-0 Teams move on to advance to the playoffs in position 5 and 6 (tiebreakers on regular season seeding), whereas the 0-2 teams are eliminated.  The remaining 1-1 teams play for the last two playoff spots on Tournament Day 3, which would be a high-stakes single elimination game.  Winners of the day 3 games advance to position 7 and 8, whereas the losers go home.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some other notes:  Could do neutral sites for the tournaments to eliminate some of the travel, or could have the higher seeds have home games during Swiss week.  Could also combine Western and Eastern seeds 5-12 to do 16 teams, which would take 3 wins to advance or 3 losses to be out.  Yes, with this format the same teams from day 1 of the tournament could potentially play again on day 3, revenge games!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways it will probably never happen but I thought it could be fun!

Not specifically based on a single year performance but more like if asking players who they consider the best player currently playing and dominating among their peers which probably takes their whole career into account until clearly there is someone generationally better.

It should roughly follow the Hart trophy winner schedule but not perfectly I would think but they all have to be of legendary status. Not just really really good.

Before Howe its a bit more fuzzy but please make suggestions.

Maybe some Russians deserve to be in there and maybe a goalie or two?

Maybe do one for defencemen and goalies too?

Morenz &gt; Shore &gt; Richard &gt; Howe &gt; Orr &gt; Gretzky &gt; Lemieux &gt; Crosby &gt; McDavid

He doesnt have a single game in the ahl. I know Buffalo needs him to be ready, but for goaltenders, it doesnt work like that. All the signs that he needed more time developing where there. He hovered around the low .900 range during his first nhl campaign (he played less than 10 games) why didnt Buffalo pickup Desmith or Reimer? Not to mention that UPL is a great goaltender, who is much better prepared to be thrusted into a starting role.

The team has plenty of offensive defenceman they need more Ekholms who can play defence. The team has zero chemistry outside of the PP which is getting shut down more often. Jay Woodcroft is the reason why the one man team jokes are real, he will kill team chemistry if he gives up on the set lines and pushes McDavid and Draisaitl together. Oilersnation said it best they are a crutch. This team has depth scoring its just if the Oilers are losing they use the crutch instead of having faith in their lines. I dont like to slander players but most of the defence aren't doing themselves any favors with the iq they play with. The goalies are left to die behind incompetent defensive plays and I hate when the goalies get blamed for defences mistakes. Woodcroft needs to worry because Tippett went on a cold streak and the team had no problem moving on, a slow start could cost his job.",nhl,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/178872b/the_oilers_are_a_disaster/

2023-10-22,1697953716,Was the 3 point rule implemented in the dead puck era?,"So the original shootouts were implemented to give fans something to stick around for, after watching 0-0 games, or low scoring defensive systems like many teams had. 

Scoring was down, and often teams would play it safe for the last 2 minutes of a tie game, to avoid potentially losing a point or even safer in OT to try and salvage 1 point, instead of losing in OT and getting no points. 

So the shootout was implemented, still 5 v 5 OT, but both teams are awarded points just for reaching OT, and the loser point is born. 

Now that its changed to 3 on 3 OT, Id assume were seeing less shootouts as compared to 5 v 5. Why doesnt the NHL change its points back too? 2 points for a regulation or OT win. And 2 &amp;1 for a shootout win/loss, if they bother keeping it. Just split the 2 points if its a tie after 3 on 3. 

At least it may clear up teams ability to move up and down the standings.",nhl,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17dmd9d/was_the_3_point_rule_implemented_in_the_dead_puck/

I wasn't quite sure what to expect but wasn't really surprised when one of the main reasons being touted was the fighting aspect that we as fans of the game are all quite familiar with. Don't get me wrong I'm not in favor of eliminating fighting because another aspect of hockey that helps keep me interested year after year is how little the game changes. Basketball and football have changed drastically over the years and as result become more challenging to enjoy because unlike hockey there's so many stoppages for reasons that in many cases don't even make sense unless you recognize it for what it is, opportunity to show even more adverts. I was fortunate to watch the Sabres vs Lightning game recently and loved it when there was a long stretch of play without a whistle. To me that's something about this beautiful and exciting free flowing game that's way more compelling than fighting if you're trying to convince someone they should become more interested in the NHL. As a counter point there was a surprisingly competitive and mostly entertaining NBA preseason game today between GS and Sacramento. That game was great until a coaches challenge occurred with 10 seconds left and it took 5 full minutes to resolve. Especially when you consider the challenge was unsuccessful. Another aspect of hockey that I love is the coach can challenge but if the call on the ice is not overturned then his team takes a 2 minute penalty.

2023-10-25,1698257230,Hot take: Goals shouldnt be challengeable because the zone entry was off-sides.,"The fact that this is apart of the game is so silly to me, if a ref misses the off-sides in the moment and the game goes on for minutes, how can all of that just be called off? The time wouldnt come back if the goal wasnt scored, so that uncalled offsides does nothing but screws the team who was offsides, and thats not even the teams fault, its the refs! 

In my opinion, while judging a fast paced game, refs miss calls and thats just how matches pan out sometimes. I understand remediating missed calls for the fairness of the game, but it seems like such an obnoxious remedy to literally turn back the game clock minutes to fix a missed call. Within a certain capacity, I think missed calls are and should be a part of the game. If in real time its indistinguishable that a play was off-sides it should be considered good.

Let me know what yall think but maybe a goal should only be able to be called back from off-sides within 30 seconds of zone entry. Even still I dont really like that idea either.

EDIT: Thinking about it further, goals should not be challengeable for offsides past 15 seconds after zone entry. This would mean that goals that occur strictly from a fast break entry that should have immediately been blown dead wont stand, but also means that if a team sustains pressure for longer than fifteen seconds, that offsides wont bite them in the ass because of an officials missed call. This makes sense to me because if there is sustained pressure in the offensive zone, the actual missed offsides call doesnt actually matter much in terms of a goal being scored, the goal wasnt a result of illegal zone entry. On the other hand, for a team that comes in offsides and scores, the lack of an offsides call directly and immediately causes a goal, and that should be called back.",nhl,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17gb2a9/hot_take_goals_shouldnt_be_challengeable_because/

The officials started setting a precedent early in the game, ignoring some dangerous hits into the boards go uncalled created a dangerous environment for the players. It led to Adam Ruzicka getting injured, being rolled into the glass head first. Now I don't think that was a suspensable hit, but to me it's only a 2 minute boarding call, but it went uncalled even though the official was staring directly at it. That standard set continued all game and there were 5 or 6 dangerous hits, some from both teams, that weren't called, I'm actually surprised there wasn't a couple more injuries because players started taking runs. There were a few people in my different hockey group chats said something to the effect of ""the refs are going to let more guys get hurt.""


I'm not here to hear about snowflakes or people keeping their head up or any of that crap. I'm worried for players. The rules are in place to keep players safe and the referees are there to call the rules, and often don't.

What happened to NHL TV in the US - obviously selling the rights to broadcast the game to different sources is lucrative for the NHL - but who really wants to pay for Cable/Dish + NHL network + ESPN + etc...

This boils into Finances;

Jersey rights sold to Fanatics - one of the WORST producers of merchandise (ok, some of it is fine, but I don't think anyone can deny that Adidas makes better jerseys). 

Ads, ads everywhere - sometimes even cutting off announcers mid-sentence. On the boards, on the ice, on the jerseys. I get we're gonna have ads, but then I remember when I watch F1... not a single ad to watch. Obviously still lots on the track, cars, and uniforms, but god is it a more pleasant viewing experience overall.

I've been watching NHL Hockey for almost 20 years now (and F1 for almost 14 years now), and I could complain about far more of the changes I've seen over the years (or lack of changes) - but these are some of the biggest concerns. I'd love to hear what folks have to say and what everyone thinks could be done to improve the league and the fan experience.

2023-10-25,1698201207,Ovechkin and the record,"TSN during the game tonight had a Quiz question about how likely it was that Ovechkin doesnt get the goal record. The highest anyone went was 25%. I agree hes more likely to get it than not, but I think the chances he doesnt get it are bigger than 25%.

Obviously injuries are a factor. As healthy as hes been during his career, all it would take would be one significant injury at this point. Hes 38. Its not all that unlikely that this happens either especially with the way he still throws his body around. 

Aside from injuries, sometimes the decline on even the best players is dramatic and steep. Look no further than the guy hes chasing. Gretz had 9 goals in his last year when he was the same age Ovechkin is now. Perhaps Jagr is a better comparison to Ovi though. Jagr did score 101 goals between Ovechkins current age and his last game in the league. If Ovi could do the same that would easily secure him the record. But I would argue that Jagr is more of a fitness beast than Ovechkin. Jagr was still way more jacked and committed to his body than probably most of the 25 year olds in the league right to the end (and probably still to this day) which easily bought him another 5-7 reasonably productive years in the league. Ovi is a beast too, but he doesnt scream fitness freak to me. Will he be able to last as long as Jagr did?

Finally, there is a theory out there that no matter what the Caps will play him until it happens at any cost. Perhaps. But, if the decline is steep, I would argue that its more likely than not they will have to stop playing him at some point in favour of younger, better players. If they were forced to stop throwing him over the boards on the PP every time on the first unit I dont see him breaking the record if hes still a ways off when that point comes. It would be really hard for him to score enough at 5 on 5 at that age to get to the record. At some point the future of their team will be more important than the record.

I still think he is more likely than not to get it, but I dont think its as much a slam dunk as many others seem too. A lot of guys have gone from star to healthy scratch to completely out of the league in a very small amount of time. Well see.",nhl,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17fujk4/ovechkin_and_the_record/

2023-10-24,1698177915,"The NHL and ""Distractions""","I'm sure we've all seen by now the NHL's decision to reverse the ban on Pride Tape, thanks to a single player (Travis Dermott) defying this ban 2 weeks into the season.

If we remember as well, the reasoning behind banning Pride Tape and displays of support for social initiatives around the league was to ""reduce distractions,"" but I think over the past week or two we've seen that the decision has done the opposite.

I understand that Bettman is a lawyer by trade, and I'm not discounting the fact that he's a knowledgeable person in his own right, but he and his executive board completely lost touch with the league and its audiences on this one.

This week alone, we've had [podcasts talk about how San Jose held their Los Tiburones night without their specialty warmup jerseys](https://youtu.be/gt3OZZ79NbY?si=oeEiasiH0eYpIvew&amp;t=424), we've had tweets about how [there are now no specialty jersey auctions](https://twitter.com/wyshynski/status/1716527136641532209) with proceeds generally going towards social causes, with note that those are much more impactful than corporate activations on the concourse, and now the past three days dedicated to Travis Dermott, Pride Tape, how he will be reprimanded, and ultimately the decision to reverse the ban on Pride Tape.

For a league that has consistently been one of the Big Four in North America, and a league that is now under threat of not being one of those Big Four leagues with the addition of Leonel Messi to MLS, it seems that the decision making coming out of the NHL has been hurting themselves more than anything, not to mention that today is their ""Frozen Frenzy"" on ESPN, which resulted in just one game yesterday, 16 games on a Tuesday afternoon, and just one game tomorrow.

TL;DR the NHL's approach to Pride Tape and supporting social causes in the name of ""reducing distractions"" has only caused more distractions from the game at hand, and might be a challenge they need to deal with for years to come.",nhl,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17flxju/the_nhl_and_distractions/

2023-10-24,1698174739,Here's a Real Idea on How to Change the Draft,"I've heard lots of talk the past few weeks about expanding out the NHL playoffs. I don't like this idea for several reasons, but that's not the purpose of this post. I won't get into that.

There's also been talk of a draft change... but that's only the mechanics of how it's done. Not any structural change to the draft itself as I understand it.

IMHO, the NHL should get creative. Do something that none of the other leagues do.

Why, instead of expanding the NHL playoffs, doesn't the NHL take the non-playoff teams and put them a bracketed playoff tournament (1 game / winner-take-all) with the winner getting the top draft pick of next year.

Call it the ""NHL Futures Tournament""

A 16-team tournament with only 1 game each would only take 7 days. This could be done at the end of the regular season before playoffs begin or less and put the final couple of tourney rounds within the first round of playoffs.

Tournament Seeding based on overall regular season record. A better record would give you a better seed.  Thus a reason to keep competitive throughout the season.

However, who gets to host the individual game during the tournament would be based on winner of season series between those two teams in regular season. This gives teams a reason to play and fans a reason to pay attention to meetings between non-playoff teams in backend of the season.

\-------------------

Benefits would include

\-Something to play for if you are a non playoff team (especially if out earlier in the season). Give those games in Feb/March/April for those teams some meaning. Would definitely boost the fan experience for those games for those teams. It's fun to cheer for something.

\-Give games between two suspected non-playoff teams some consequence.  You can't lose and maybe give up on home advantage vs a team you may end up facing in the draft tourney.

\-Get rid of a draft based on luck/tanking for high generational / #1 draft picks. Make teams have to earn those special players instead of getting them (or losing them if you are top chance to win but lose because of the draw) based on dumb luck.

\-Non playoff teams have potential to generate several games of additional revenue.

\-Disincentive to Tanking. You have to at least keep competitive throughout season for the ranking / home advantage / momentum in draft pick tournament.

\-Get top end talent into winning situations where they can be part of successful teams and thus be marketed faster. Don't have the Connor Bedard's of the world have to sit on rebuilding teams for the first half their career (like McDavid did). Instead let them be franchise revitalizers for teams that are trying to remain competitive (which we should all want).

\--During the game, you can promote the heck out of the pick the winner would make. Maybe even have the winning team officialy make that piclk at the conclusion of the final. Have that kids (or kids if non consensus pick) there for the final game and promote the hell out of him. Show him at the end of the game coming out to celebrate with the team. What a memory. What a marketing dream.

\-------------------

Lower tier teams would still get their high tier picks in subsequent rounds. Lowest point team would get pick #2 (unless they win the draft tourney) in first round and #1 of subsequent rounds. Winning team would slot into their normal slot based on regular season rankings in rounds 2-7.

Thus, the worst ranked teams will still get many high draft pics with which to rebuild their teams over several seasons. Just not the huge reward of THE top pick for their poor record.

It would just be an added element of fun and excitement for what otherwise can become the a string of meaningless games.

Hockey friends,

You may have seen me posting these lately. It started simply enough; I just wanted to see the CBJ uni mocked up in a different way. Then I decided to redesign all the sweaters that I hated. Now, I'm just doing all of them for fun. I hope you're enjoying these. I certainly am.

**Dallas Stars**

I felt Dallas missed the mark on their rebrand, so I went back and found a middle ground. They've been around 30 years now and I saw u/AndyMoogThe35 mention they had not done anything, so I quickly made a very simple 30th patch and a new Texas shoulder patch.

2023-10-22,1697998989,How to become a better student of the game?,"How do you all recommend becoming a good student of hockey? I watch a lot of broadcasts and always hear commentators talking about how ""x player should have been over here so y player could have done z"" or ""the forecheck is really weak tonight"" or ""x player seems to be slower than usual because he's out of regular formation on this line and normally would have gotten pucks like that"" or ""usually x goaltender would have stopped a shot like that because that's his strong side"" etc. 

As somebody who never actually played ice hockey growing up but has been a fan of the game for 10+ years, owns a few jerseys, is a season ticket holder for my local minor league team, and watches NHL broadcasts religiously, I feel like I should understand more of what the coaches, commentators, and players talk about when they're making comments. 

I have a good grasp on the technical rules of the game, different penalties, why they're called, etc. But the strategy of setting up lines, slotting players, and such is where I'm lacking.

Any advice as to how I can get better at this, what I should be watching for (both on TV and at the local arena), and learning frameworks to think about what's happening on the ice would be greatly appreciated.

2023-10-26,1698363853,A conversation needs to be had about referees in the NHL.,"Reffing is atrocious. We all know it. But recently, it's been getting seriously out of hand. Players are making some seriously dangerous hits with the assumption that the refs won't call it, and so far, they're justified in that assumption. I know we've been complaining for a while, but if we actually want to make a change, we need to band together and collectively make it known that refs being held to such a low standard is absolutely unacceptable. I can understand missing a call occasionally, but choosing to issue minors for blatant boards which should be game misconducts, or just outright ignoring them, is not acceptable, and it's beyond the reaches of plausible deniability. 

Many users have suggested making refs answer press questions, which seems like an obvious solution, but the league seems adamant that they have no ambition of persuing that option. This goes beyond simply the sport of hockey; refs being so ignorant to the game they're being paid to officiate is genuinely dangerous to the health of the players on the ice. Another option I've considered is the ability for teams to negotiate and select a neutral referee that they'd like to officiate their game.",nhl,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17ha6a6/a_conversation_needs_to_be_had_about_referees_in/

2023-10-26,1698322566,Anyone else find the regular season boring?,"Greetings:

A little background: I have been a Bruins fan since I can remember (born 1986) and had season tickets from 2008-2015. From 2008 to 2013 I probably missed less than 5 home games per season. I have been a poster on HF Boards since 2005 as well. I have been struggling the past few seasons to get into the regular season. This includes the Bruins ""record Setting"" season last year. I can think of a few reasons:

1. The schedule where you play every team twice. When I started my season tickets you played the division 8 times. Then it moved to 6, now it seems to be 4 to 3 times. The west cost games were always the most boring, but at least there were not many. IMO, familiarity breeds contempt and hockey played at this level is the most entertaining. I would not want to have season tickets now when you have to suffer through a home game against every out of conference team Zzzzz. The league got it half right with divisional playoffs but did not follow it up with a heavy divisional schedule. I couldn't name more than a few players for the Canadiens now, not the case in 2011.
2. As a follow up to #2, so many games lack much emotion. I was never a huge fan of the goon fights but give me something to cheer about that is not just a goal. Hockey used to be the only sport you did not shut off during a blowout because some of the best line brawls happened at the end of games. Now with all the rules/suspensions, everyone is jut going through the motions. The 6'5"" ""enforcers"" did a lot to scare the league into these rules but I wish they would make them more lax now and have the more skilled players able to air their grievances once in a while.
3. Everything is way to over coached and the talent pool, IMO, is too deep. Sometimes mistakes lead to  more interesting goals/action. Players in the Bottom six went from tough and entertaining to ""defensive specialists"" who best qualities are that they block shots or get their sticks in lanes. Also, because of the rules I mentioned in #2, no coaching is going to throw a game away to send a message like we used to see in Detroit Colorado or the infamous Bruins North Stars game.

Now I get that a lot of this is to protect the players and we are not going back BUT for me at least, it doesn't make me like the game anymore or commit two hours per night a few times as week. Without fighting or the threat of a fight, I have been watching way more college hockey the past few seasons. Much more action and unpredictability.

I'm using the Colley Matrix iteration process ([https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html](https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html))

To summarize, you take the win percentage of every team and correct it against the win percentage of their opponents. Then you have a new win percentage.

Personally I dont care, when I play at the ODR I only every wear a toque.

2023-10-31,1698733851,An example of how often players get torpedo'd causing skates to come up,"With the tragic incident with Adam Johnson, I saw so many people that are 100% certain that there's no way you can ""accidentally"" have your legs go that high from a collision. Today, I saw a similar torpedo style result from a collision, when Cal Clutterbuck went to take the body, and held up at the last second, causing his feet to kick up upon contact.

Fortunately, no skaters were around, and it was a non-event.

But this is a good example of the torpedo effect that can happen from an innocent looking play. Yes, it is a bit different of a scenario and angle, but it's still comparable. 

What caused it here? I have a take on that. When players let up to avoid brutal knee on knee contact, the weight is taken off the legs, and they can be flipped. You even see it when players drive fill speed toward the net and try to avoid the goalie, they end up flipping over the goalie.

Can this type of result he avoided? In this case, I'm not sure what Clutterbuck should have done differently. He was going for a hit, and the puck carrier made a drop pass, so Clutterbuck aborted the hit, but was in line for a bad knee on knee collision if he didn't take the weight off his left leg. And so he got launched. His legs went up. Would he be a ""murderer"" if it made fatal incidental contact?",nhl,418,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17kepok/an_example_of_how_often_players_get_torpedod/

2023-10-30,1698678356,"Hot take: Bruins, Caps, Leafs and Rangers should have had more Stanley Cups than the Penguins since 2005","In the post lockout era I couldn't think of a less deserving Cup winner than the Penguins. No President's Trophies in the Crosby era, their best players only dominated the league for 1-2 yrs and they have zero playoff series wins in the 2020s and no playoff series wins since 2018. They also missed playoffs in the most stacked Stanley Cup playoffs of the last decade while a 35-yr old Crosby couldn't even get 100 points in the highest scoring season in 50 years. This season the Penguins are 29th in the league after 8 games and it's certain they will not bounce back ever again with how good everyone but the Sharks, Oilers and Flames are now. At this point I expect a team like the Avs, Leafs or NYR to finish the season with 66 wins breaking 22-23 Boston's 65 win record while the Penguins with Erik Karlsson will be lucky to get to win 30 and Crosby doesn't even get to 80 pts.

The Bruins, Caps until last season and Rangers are far more successful in the last decade but you arent ready for that conversation. If you ask me which core I'd rather have to lead my team to a Cup dynasty, besides the 10-15 Hawks give me Bergeron's Bruins, Trouba's NYR, JT's Leafs and Ovi's 2018 Caps core any day. If the Avs keep it up they'll finish with 4 Cups with their current core too. The stats don't lie since 2005:

Bruins: 3 President's Trophies, 1 Stanley Cup, 3 SCF appearances, most wins in the regular season in NHL history with 65 wins in the same season the Penguins broke their 16-yr playoff streak, longest active playoff streak in the NHL tied with the Leafs, 7-0-1 start despite Bergeron and Krejci retiring. Which is who everyone thought the Penguins would be.

NYR: 5 ECF appearances, 1 President's Trophy, top of the Eastern Conference in 2012 and 2023, 6-2-0 start in October with 3 players on pace to be 100-pt scorers, never blew playoff series leads

Caps: 1 Stanley Cup, 3 President's Trophies, 4 Metropolitan Division titles

Leafs: longest active playoff streak in the NHL tied with Boston, has a playoff series win in 2020s, 5 consecutive 100-pt seasons

Penguins: No playoff series wins in 2020s (Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and Philadelphia have more btw), no playoff series wins 2018, high chance of missing playoffs again in 2024 because the East is unstoppable right now, 3-5-0 to start the season,  16th in the East in October, no President's Trophies, 3 Cups in 4 appearances against cupcake competition, only 2 Metropolitan Division titles, most blown playoff series leads ever in NHL history

YouTube TV has never been a provider of the NHL Network in the US. Furthermore, never have they publicly stated their reasoning for not negotiating a fair deal for the NHL Network, which is 84.4% owned by the NHL and 15.6% owned by NBCUniversal.

Its time for YouTubeTV to add the NHL Network to its sports channel lineup. If youre a YTTV subscriber (or even if you are not), I urge you to INUNDATE them with messages of your interest in an effort to have them add NHL Network.

Anyone, subscriber or non-subscriber, can go to this web page &

[https://goo.gle/3EEQ9td](https://t.co/tvyMPxGDyw)

& and tell them to add NHL Network. My hope is that if everyone who reads this takes just one minute to tell them of your interest, it MIGHT convince them to finally consider the requests.

PLEASE consider doing this for all US NHL fans.

It shouldn't take a player dying for the NHL and IIHF to realize that this long overdue change needs to be made.  The same thing happened with helmets where it took a player dying for the NHL to realize this is something that should be implemented.

Good afternoon,

I'm a younger Pens fan and I have a question about something I recently saw on another sub in a thread about ""clean"" athletes that actually have some issues in their past.

Despite me not wanting it to be true, I saw that Mario has a few issues regarding the issue of [r@pe](mailto:r@pe). Once ALLEDGIDLY being witness to it, and once being somewhat dismissive of it. Besides an [LA Times article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-21-sp-712-story.html) in 1992, can't seem to see anything about this minus me searching online and seeing some Pittsburgh people saying the local media has been embarrassingly soft on him.

I was wondering if anyone remembers this and can shine some light on the situation as my dad raised me to be a huge fan and if there are validity to any of this or any other big negative issues in his past I'd be broken.

To summarize, you take the win percentage of every team and correct it against the win percentage of their opponents. Then you have a new win percentage.

I've watched the sharks since I can remember (born in 94, considered myself able to understand hockey in 04) and have watched all the highs, and all of the many, many MANY lows. 

I consider myself objective in most opinions, biased towards the sharks by a bit, biased against the knights, kings and ducks by a bit, but overall I try very hard to put those feelings to the side when talking about hockey. 

I never played, but my dad did and taught me correct vs incorrect plays. However I'm fully aware of how much of a lack of understanding comes from not experiencing the ice for myself.

My team is the worst I've seen in my life. I'm getting drunk and high. Ask me anything. Perhaps it'll give me an outlet. Perhaps it'll give me false help. Or maybe it'll drive me to the point where I no longer feel anything towards hockey. Ask me anything

2023-11-04,1699066590,Poll: Should NHL President Gary Bettman step down for not telling Landauer about the Dadonov violation?,"News continues to swirl around the Ottawa Senators this week as long-time General Manager Pierre Dorion was fired for an administration mistake resulting in negligence around the trade of Evgenii Dadonov to the Los Vegas Golden Knights.

The NHL decided to charge the Ottawa Senators a first-round draft pick as a result, a very steep price to pay for an admin error. The Senators forgot to send Los Vegas Dadonov's no trade clause when he was traded. Which, as Andlauer says, made the NHL look foolish when the news came out.

At the same time the NHL didn't reveal to Mr. Andlauer how serious the offence was when he was doing his due-diligence to buy the team earlier this year. So, we ask... Should NHL President Gary Bettman be turfed from his job as former Sens GM Pierre Dorion was this week for omitting information for potential benefit?

One specific one is about the stars of the game. Obviously its based on the players performance, how many goals/assists/saves etc. But I wonder about how much weight each category adds to calculating what star someone is. 

For example, in the Canucks/Sharks game last night(Nov 2, 2023) the second star had 1g, 2a, while the third star had 2g, 1a. In my head, a goal weighs more than an assist, but here that wasnt the determinant. What are the other factors? Is it also based on plus/minus, hits, etc? Im just curious.

2023-11-06,1699309575,Michael Misa is a Generational Player,"In 2023, the game changed.

Connor Bedardthe Chicago Blackhawks rookie phenom and Regina Pats alumni wow'd the world with his elite playmaking ability and an electric highlight reel ( [https://youtu.be/WB3VR2aIM-Q?si=x4nnwAbtExl09Glq](https://youtu.be/WB3VR2aIM-Q?si=x4nnwAbtExl09Glq) ). Going 1st overall in the 2023 NHL entry draft, the 18-year old superstar has since taken the league by storm. But this comes as no surprise to anyone who's been watching this young star's rise to the NHL.

In 2020, he was the first ever Vancouver native to have received exceptional status in the WHL at 15; in 2022, he was labeled a ""generational talent"" by the NHL's official PR team, receiving praise from the likes of Kelly Hrudey and Paul Bissionnette; and in 2023, he won gold at the World Juniors, scoring the ""golden goal"" that secured Team Canada's win over the Czechs in the dying minutes of double overtime.

In the present, the world watches this young man's historic journey into the record books, as he continues to flash shades of the greats that paved the way ( [https://youtu.be/vtYDMP5Vp30?si=n9cepBvD5XN9X7dt](https://youtu.be/vtYDMP5Vp30?si=n9cepBvD5XN9X7dt) , [https://youtu.be/9yeFak3D7MU?si=XRZiMesh1E-zX2fm](https://youtu.be/9yeFak3D7MU?si=XRZiMesh1E-zX2fm) ). But while Connor Bedard is the undeniable superstar of his class, many can't help but look on to the future...

Who is the NEXT one?

&amp;#x200B;

""They ask me, they say, 'is he a generational player', and my answer to them is always the same         ([https://youtu.be/XiRoXzhQz5Q?si=1GyQGxhGbqmLNHos](https://youtu.be/XiRoXzhQz5Q?si=1GyQGxhGbqmLNHos)) how much has he evolved the game?""( [https://youtu.be/hbIvWYDpvJ4?si=EG3VbM62lMR\_Y7qE](https://youtu.be/hbIvWYDpvJ4?si=EG3VbM62lMR_Y7qE) ).

Enter Michael Misa ([https://youtu.be/xOmlAT\_KvzI?si=UJupmPqwZzBm3\_En](https://youtu.be/xOmlAT_KvzI?si=UJupmPqwZzBm3_En) ). Granted exceptional status by the OHL in 2022, the Saginaw Spirit forward has been lighting it up ([https://youtu.be/nwK4MWDIfD0?si=6uQ2\_YYM7Tzh0\_tk](https://youtu.be/nwK4MWDIfD0?si=6uQ2_YYM7Tzh0_tk)). With his elite playmaking and an ability to score some of the most electrifying goals, it's left many wondering the same thing: is he the NEXT Bedard?

""Y'know he's a talent we haven't seen since maybe, I dunno, Gretzky? The kid is just unreal! He has skill, he has size, he's got the speed to rival anyonehe's the full package. Honestly, and I know that this is early, but I think he just might be the most evolved player in the world right now"".

Projected to be the 1st overall pick in the 2025 NHL entry draft, expectations are sky-high for this talented Ontario native. In hockey, with every generation comes a player that'll change the game forever, and with Connor McDavid in the twilight of his career, it's only a matter of time until he passes the torch. In 2025, Michael Misa just might be the NEXT one.

Until then, let's just enjoy the 2023 season. Goodnight.

2023-11-05,1699210598,How Protected Are No Trade Lists,"I was watching a video from Eck (of Eckhart's Ladder fame - popular Star Wars YouTuber who crossed into sports commentary as a viewer/personality, not a knowledgeable insider) about how many players don't want to play for the Leafs because of the pressure, and he mentioned that no trade lists aren't publicly published so fans can't be upset at players that don't want to play for their hometown team.  And with the recent punishment of the Senators for their issues with a no trade list, it got me thinking.

How are no trade lists handled, and how protected are they?

Clearly, the league doesn't hold onto the list and make it available for teams to peruse with an understanding that disseminating information will be punished.  And I could see how that could be abused if a team truly accidentally or 'accidentally' leaked any part of the list.

But if the Leafs called the Coyotes for a trade, are the Coyotes allowed to say ""no, you're on this guy's list - we couldn't do Alex Kerfoot for Matthews straight up if we wanted to because of Kerfoot's NMC, don't ask"", or do the Coyotes have to ask the player for permission to specifically say that it's not worth asking again because the player has the right to decline?

2023-11-05,1699193466,Out-of-Market NHL Games,"*The mods can delete this post if it breaks the rules!*

So, forgive my stupidity, but what is an out-of-market NHL game? Is an out-of-market game like a regional blackout?

For example, I'm a Canucks fan. I can't watch certain games on TV because of regional blackout. So, would those games be considered out-of-market games?

With this in mind and the reason I'm asking, if I were to subscribe to Sportsnet Premium, which plays out-of-market games, would I be able to get all of the Canucks games?

Thanks in advance!

**Edit:** Since I'm not really getting a straight answer, I spoke online with a customer service rep. Apparently I can get all Canucks games with Sportsnet Premium, which is the answer I was looking for. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Note:*** *Before people say, ""Don't subscribe to Sportsnet! It's a shitty streaming service!"" I've been receiving mixed reviews about it, some saying that, others saying they haven't had any issues with the service. I'm considering giving it a shot myself to see if it's any good and unsubscribing if it's not. I want to be able to watch my Canucks, but don't want to waste my money if I can't get all of the games hence why I'm asking. Sportsnet Premium plays all of the out-of-market NHL games according to their website.*",nhl,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17ocrcy/outofmarket_nhl_games/

2023-11-08,1699420470,Brodeur vs Fleury,"Brodeur as we know has the most wins for any goalie. Fleury is currently 3rd and will pass Roy for 2nd before the season is over barring a devastating injury.

Brodeur benefited from the trap and having 2 HOF defensemen(Stevens-Niedermaier) and an extremely underrated defenseman(Rafalski) in front of him. Fleury benefitted from having a top 10 all time player and top 5 if healthy(Crosby) and another HOF forward(Malkin) scoring goals.

Fleurys career save percentage is actually higher. He also has put up 5 .920+ SV% seasons to Brodeurs 3. Brodeur also had the advantage of playing in the dead puck era where scoring was way down and still couldnt put up .920 SV% seasons like Hasek was. Even Roy was able to put up .920 SV% seasons from 97-03. He was also putting up .910+ SV% seasons in the early 90s.

 I'm using the Colley Matrix iteration process ([https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html](https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html))

To summarize, you take the win percentage of every team and correct it against the win percentage of their opponents. Then you have a new win percentage. And I repeat that process until the correction factor is below .001. Essentially this is what I would expect the win percentages to be if the teams played an average team every game.",nhl,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/17q4uv8/week_4_adjusted_win/

Stars game last night on Sportsnet Premium - those two can't be the best that NESN can put forward for announcers is it? I was honestly so bored with them that I eventually just muted the TV and streamed a local radio broadcast over them. The color commentator was alright, but the PbP guy (Jack Edwards?) was so bad it made me want to ask for my money back. If they're old and slowing down, fine - but how does NESN and Sportsnet not recognize that they have on-air personnel with the verbal enthusiasm of an analogue clock? Replace them with someone who brings a little fire to the game... or someone who gives a damn about their job.
