This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(haven)
setwd("C:/Users/student/Downloads")
df <- read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
df %>% 
  filter(age!=0) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = age))+labs(title="Percentage of Vists by Age", caption = "The most common age to have vists at a doctor is around 80 years old.")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
